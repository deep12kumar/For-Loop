# For-Loop

For Loop in C Language provides a functionality/feature to recall a set of conditions for a defined number of times, moreover, this methodology of calling checked conditions automatically is known as for loop.

for loop is in itself a form of an entry-controlled loop. It is mainly used to traverse arrays, vectors, and other data structures.

Syntax of for loop in C
for(initialization; check/test expression; updation)
{    
     // body consisting of multiple statements
}

Structure of for Loop in C
for loop follows a very structured approach where it begins with initializing a condition then checks the condition and in the end executes conditional statements followed by an updation of values.

Initialization: This is the first parameter of a fundamental for loop that accepts a conditional variable that iterates the value or helps in checking the condition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Conditional Statement: It accepts 3 parameters(Initialization, Condition, and Updation) that indicate what condition needs to be followed and checked.
Check/Test Condition: The Second parameter of a fundamental for loop defines the condition that needs to be followed to run the following code statements. In simple terms, if the check expression is true then the iteration of the loop continues otherwise the loop is terminated and further checks(if possible/there) are left unchecked.
Updation: The Third parameter of a fundamental for loop defines the incrementation or decrementation of the conditional variable that will iterate the code according to the condition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Body: It is termed as the collection of statements i.e. variables, functions, etc. These are executed automatically after a successful iteration that executes with every successful iteration cycle until the condition is not satisfied. The code statements within the for loop could be anything from printing a simple name to executing complex algorithms or functional statements.
